        I&apos;m Clive Limo, a full stack developer from Kenya. With a passion
        for web development and a comprehensive skill set in front-end and
        back-end technologies, I love pushing the boundaries of what&apos;s
        possible. Drawing inspiration from Kenya&apos;s vibrant tech scene and
        blending it with global trends, I strive to create innovative and
        visually captivating digital experiences. When I&apos;m not coding,
        you&apos;ll find me immersed in pop music, translating its essence into
        unique portraits and immersive universes. I thrive on collaboration and
        am always eager to tackle new challenges. Let&apos;s connect and make a
        positive impact together!
